## Setup
Currently this library can only send messages, it cannot read for messages or do anything else. 

Go to setup.py and bot.py and replace the token and channelid with your token and channelid.

### Running
Run setup.py, which will start a websocket connection with discord. Once you have done this, run bot.py.
